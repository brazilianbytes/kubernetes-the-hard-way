# Prerequisites

## ~~Google Cloud Platform~~ Raspberry PI

This tutorial doesn't need to use any cloud provider, we are using bare metal Raspberry PI 4 nodes with minimun 4 GB RAM.

> Depending on the country you live in, may be tricky or expensive to buy RPI 4 nowadays (like BR is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

## Running Commands in Parallel with ~~tmux~~ Terminator

I prefer to work with Terminator. Please follow this [tutorial](https://linoxide.com/terminator-multiple-gnome-terminal-one-window/) to learn how to install and use it.

> The use of Terminator is optional and not required to complete this tutorial.
